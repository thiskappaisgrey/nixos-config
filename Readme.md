# My nixos config

This configuration is a work in progress. I may or may not(in the future) move
to home-manager in the future(not sure if it's worth it). All the programs that
I used are installed under the system level because, well, I'm the only one
using my computer. 


I'm experimenting with different keyboard layouts. The halmak layout is pretty
recent so it didn't get added to Linux's xkbmap yet. Manually adding it in my
configuration(and copied over the code from here: https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak )
