# My nixos config

This configuration is a work in progress. I may or may not(in the future) move
to home-manager in the future(not sure if it's worth it). All the programs that
I used are installed under the system level because, well, I'm the only one
using my computer. 

I am attempting to learn the workman layout(I will be getting/building a split
keyboard soon, so I'll have to relearn how to type anyways. Also, my wpm is 60
on a **good** day... usually hangs around 40 wpm, so i'm not going to lose much
by switching...) On my machine, xorg took a whopping **12 minutes** (to be fair,
it's a thinkpad t480 with a 1.6 GHz processor.) to compile the new keyboard
layout, so do be patient if you too want to add a new keyboard layout to your
nixos config.

This config contains code from: https://github.com/workman-layout/Workman (the
[./xorg](folder)).
The Workman Keyboard Layout is created by OJ Bucao, learn more here:
